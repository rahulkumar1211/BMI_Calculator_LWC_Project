# BMI_Calculator_LWC_Project
BMI, or Body Mass Index, is a measure that indicates whether a person is underweight, healthy, overweight, or obese based on their weight and height. Our BMI Calculator provides a simple yet effective interface for users to input their weight and height, and instantly receive their BMI result along with a corresponding health category.
